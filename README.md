# Hello-World
This is my first repository

I'm excited to get started, and look forward to becoming a contributing member of the GitHub community!

## A Reminder to Future Me...
I know I'm gonna need to need a markdown cheat sheet getting started so I'm going to add some notes here:<p>
**Headings** - to create headings use the # sign. '#' is the equivalent to the h1 tag, while '##' is h2, and so on...
**Bolding Font** - to bold font, use ** before and after the word you wish to make bold.<p>
_Italicizing_ font - to italicize a font, just use the underscore "_" before and after the word or words.<p>
- **bullet points** - to create a bullet point, start a new line of text and start it with a hyphen.<p>
`inline code` - to make inline code, use a back tick ` before and after your word or words.
